DinnerTime is an API written on Django Rest Framework, a service for ordering fast food delivery from a restaurant.

The company, leaves a request to connect it to the program DinnerTime. After the approval of the administration, it can connect its employees by means of sending them an email, setting each tariff (the amount for lunches included at the expense of the company).

Then, the employee, by viewing the menu, selects the products he likes and sends the order to the manager of the company, where she processes them, and then sends the general order to the kitchen.
